# Crop-Recommendation-Project
🌾 Crop Recommendation System

📌** Overview**

This project is a machine learning-based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental conditions like NPK levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

The system leverages machine learning and data-driven analysis to recommend crops that enhance agricultural yield while promoting long-term sustainability and resource efficiency. This helps farmers make informed decisions based on soil and climate conditions, ultimately improving productivity and supporting sustainable agriculture.

✨ **Features**

Predicts the best crop based on soil and climate data.

Supports multiple models for comparison:  - Logistic Regression  - Decision Tree  - Random Forest  - LSTM (Deep Learning)  - CNN-LSTM (Deep Learning)

Displays accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.

Visual bar chart comparing model performance.

⚙️ **Requirements**

Python 3.x

Libraries:  - pandas, numpy  - matplotlib, seaborn  - scikit-learn  - keras, tensorflow

Install required packages using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

📊** Dataset**

The dataset used is Crop_recommendation.csv and contains the following features:

N: Nitrogen

P: Phosphorus

K: Potassium

temperature: in °C

🧐 **Model Implementation**

Logistic Regression: Simple baseline model

Decision Tree: Rule-based classification

Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees

LSTM: Deep learning model for sequential data

CNN-LSTM: Hybrid deep learning model combining CNN and LSTM layers

Each model is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix (normalized in %)

Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

🔮 **Future Improvements**

Develop a web interface using Flask or Streamlit.

Integrate real-time user input.

Experiment with more advanced models like XGBoost or transformers.

Deploy the system on the cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Cloud).

Add location-based predictions using GPS and satellite data.
